        These women were made into Specimens because of their suffering. The
        medical systems of the time could not protect their health and even
        after death, the American medical system took advantage of their bodies.
        They did not consent to their bodies being used in this way.
      </p>
      <p class="conclusion">
        Now, Harriet and Henrietta live on, in our pages and in these pixels and
        in physical distorted forms of their original selves. Harriets nervous
        system watches over the students of Drexel University. The total mass of
        Henriettas cells weighs over 50 million metric tons.
      </p>
      <p class="conclusion">
        Much good has come from their bodies in education and public health. We
        can honor their legacies through our education. We can remember and
        repeat their names: Henrietta Lacks and Harriet Cole.
