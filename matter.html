        Dr. George Gey collected bodies. As a cell biologist, he was supplied
        with an endless amount of cancer tissue from patients in local
        hospitals, no questions asked.
      </p>
      <p class="mindmatter" style="top: 18vw; left: 23vw; width: 32vw">
        In 1956, Gey found the perfect specimen for his work: a tumor of
        cervical tissue that grew so aggressively that it practically refused to
        die... a lump of cancer and blood.
      </p>
      <p class="mindmatter" style="top: 46vw; left: 60vw">
        Gey was going to create the first immortal human cancer cell line.
      </p>
      <p class="mindmatter" style="top: 75vw; width: 70vw; left: 5vw">
        The tumor was scraped into a tube with a solution of chicken blood and
        cow fetus and umbilical cord and salt. Slowly it turned in a metal drum,
        swirling and growing in the dark.
      </p>
      <p class="mindmatter" style="top: 100vw; width: 50vw; left: 30vw">
        This was not the first Specimen Gey tried creating. Most other cancer
        cells died in the dark tubes after a few days, but this tumor was
        different. All it needed was an energy source: the solution.
      </p>
      <p class="mindmatter" style="top: 133vw; width: 60vw; left: 5vw">
        Gey had created a piece of human body that would never die. He shared his Specimen with the medical community. It was
        blasted with radiation and infected with polio, AIDS, COVID. It was killed
        millions of times over and still, undead it remained, allowing us to unlock the
        limits of the human body.
      </p>

      <p class="mindmatter" style="top: 164vw; left: 50vw">
        The body was now a Specimen.
